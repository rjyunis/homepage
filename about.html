<p>
I work in the Aerospace sector, performing vibrations and shock analysis. I hold a B.S. in Physics with a minor in Astronomy, and am pursuing a M.S. in Aerospace Engineering with a concentration in Structural Dynamics. My relevant core competencies include mathematics, programming, and finite element analysis, including Craig Bampton model reduction. I also have experience with Femap, Nastran, and LS-Dyna.
<br>
I am always open to hearing about interesting new opportunities. A copy of my resume is available in the uploads section. You can also reach me below, if you think I would be a good fit for your team.
